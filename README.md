1. [Four paradigms of Science](https://dsaikrishna.wordpress.com/2021/08/29/four-paradigms-of-science/)

Data Science is the fourth paradigm of Science. It is akin to Galileo taking observations through a telescope, but todayâ€™s Galileo has a telescope that can generate hundreds of GBs of data per day. The problem is that there are not enough Galileos to interpret this data and create more theories.

2. [Bayesian Thinking for a Better world](https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Blogs/Anviksiki/bayesian-thinking.html)

 We all start with problematic opinions - be it about gender, castes, religions etc. But when the world shows you counter evidence, are you updating your opinions? If not, you are not thinking well. Let some high school math show you why and how to update opinions.

3. [Why doctors need Bayes?](https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Blogs/Anviksiki/bayes-doctor.html)

How doctors can end up overtreating when they lack knowledge of Bayes' theorem. 

4. [Why anecdotal evidence is BS?](https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Blogs/Anviksiki/anecdotal-bs.html)

 People give you anecdotal evidence to justify all sorts of non-sense. You want to tell them that anecdotal evidence is useless. But their stories are very strong and emotional. Hence, let's use same math to call out anecdotal evidence. Don't worry, we just use high school math for this.
