# Central Limit Theorem

Even if the population is not normal, sampling distribution of means is normal. (can be considered the same for sampling distribution of any other stat - variance, sum etc)

Generally considered when n>30; but works sometimes for lesser n also - especially when population is normal.

Once the sampling distribution is normal - you can use z-stat to calculate confidence interval.

If the sample size is very small - we can consider that the sampling distribution is in t-distribution (t-stat). This is applicable only if population is normal distribution!
