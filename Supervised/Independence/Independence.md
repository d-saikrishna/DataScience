# Independence

If two variables are dependent (associated). It doesn't imply any causation.

## Two Continous variables

To test if two variables are independent (not associated), we use the correlation coefficient.

Note: If the coefficient is 0, we cannot reject dependency. But if coefficient is not 0, we can say that variables are dependent/associated. 


## QnA

1. If association/correlation is sufficient for prediction, can we use spurious correlations for predictions?

Correlations have predictive power, when we assume that this correlation continues to exist (in future or on the test set we are predicting). A spurious correlation may not hold this prediction.
