# Linear Programming
1. Define variables
2. Define Objective Function (Maximisation or Minimisation)
3. Set constraints

## Solvers:

## Edge cases:
[Alternate Solutions, Infeasibility, Unboundedness, Redundancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eMA0LWsRQQ)
- There can be multiple optimal solutions for a LP problem. Different solvers would choose different solutions in such cases. [Here is a good write up on why that would happen.](https://orinanobworld.blogspot.com/2013/08/different-solvers-different-solutions.htmls)

Here is some good discussion on retreiving multiple optimal solutions (because solvers don't retieve all)
