# Introduction

Visitors to [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/) are welcomed with a question about common misconceptions. Here is one of them.

![](https://data-science-with-r.github.io/images/gapminder-co2-question.png)

Once you make your selection, you are directed to a page that explains the right answer and shows a visualization of the distribution of responses from various countries.

![](https://data-science-with-r.github.io/images/gapminder-co2-answers.png)

Our goal is to create a version of this visualization.

## Packages

We will use the **tidyverse** and **scales** packages for data wrangling and visualization.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
```

## Data

The data we're going to use is in a CSV file called `co2-emissions.csv` at <https://data-science-with-r.github.io/data/co2-emissions.csv>.

```{r}
#| label: load-data
co2_emissions <- read_csv("https://data-science-with-r.github.io/data/co2-emissions.csv")
```

And let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: view-data
co2_emissions
```

# Analysis

-   Pivot the `co2_emissions` data frame *longer* such that each row represents a country / answer type combination and `answer_type` and `percentage` for that country are columns in the data frame.

```{r}
#| label: pivot
co2_emissions_pivoted <- co2_emissions |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !country,
    names_to = "answer_type",
    values_to = "percentage"
  )
```

-   Create a stacked bar plot of response type by countries.

```{r}
#| label: stacked-bar-plot
ggplot(co2_emissions_pivoted,
       aes(y = country, x = percentage, fill = answer_type )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y="Country",
       x="Percentage",
       fill="Answers")
```

-   In the original plot, the levels of `answer_type` are in the order Very wrong, Wrong, and Correct. Update the previous plot reorder the levels in this order.

```{r}
#| label: reorder-answer-type
co2_emissions_pivoted |>
  mutate(answer_type = fct_rev(fct_relevel(answer_type,
                                   "Very wrong", "Wrong", "Correct"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = country, x = percentage, fill = answer_type )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y="Country",
       x="Percentage",
       fill="Answers")
```

-   Update the colors of the plot to match the original plot:
    -   Very wrong: #96283A
    -   Wrong: #DB4C67
    -   Correct: #C8F0BF

```{r}
#| label: colors
co2_emissions_pivoted |>
  mutate(answer_type = fct_rev(fct_relevel(answer_type,
                                   "Very wrong", "Wrong", "Correct"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = country, x = percentage, fill = answer_type )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y="Country",
       x="Percentage",
       fill="Answers") + 
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "Very wrong" =  "#96283A",
      "Wrong" =  "#DB4C67",
      "Correct" = "#C8F0BF"
    )
  )
```

-   Move the legend to the bottom and make sure the levels appear in the same order they appear in the plot.

```{r}
#| label: move-legend
co2_emissions_pivoted |>
  mutate(answer_type = fct_rev(fct_relevel(answer_type,
                                   "Very wrong", "Wrong", "Correct"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = country, x = percentage, fill = answer_type )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y="Country",
       x="Percentage",
       fill="Answers") + 
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "Very wrong" =  "#96283A",
      "Wrong" =  "#DB4C67",
      "Correct" = "#C8F0BF"
    ), 
    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

-   Reorder countries to match the original plot -- in increasing order of corect percentages.

```{r}
#| label: reorder-country
co2_emissions_pivoted |>
  mutate(answer_type = fct_rev(fct_relevel(answer_type,
                                   "Very wrong", "Wrong", "Correct")), 
         country = fct_rev(fct_relevel(country,"TÃ¼rkiye", "Columbia", "Sweden", "Germany", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Kenya", "Pakistan"))) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = country, x = percentage, fill = answer_type )) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "Very wrong" =  "#96283A",
      "Wrong" =  "#DB4C67",
      "Correct" = "#C8F0BF"
    ), 
    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale =1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y= NULL,
       x= NULL,
       fill= NULL,
       title = "Survey results",
       subtitle = "Of the perople tested, 67% got it wrong",
       caption = "Data source: GapMinder") 
```

-   Update labels and other elements of the plot to get it closer to the original plot.

```{r}
#| label: update-labels
# add code here
