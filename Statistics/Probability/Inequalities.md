# Inequalities

Inequalites helps in bounding the quantity we want to measure, when it is hard to measure otherwise.

## [Markov's inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-nAr3MkAII)

$P(X >= t) <= \frac{E(X)}{t}$

## [Chebyshev's inequality!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlelI1LA9o4)

$P(\mu - k.\sigma < x < \mu + k.\sigma) >= 1- \frac{1}{k^2}$

It can also be written as

$P(|X - \mu| >= t) <= \frac{Var(X)}{t^2}$

It is derived from Markov's inequality.
